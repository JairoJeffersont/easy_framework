# Simple PHP API Application

This is a simple PHP framework for APIs that demonstrates basic routing, handling HTTP requests, and organizing controllers for CRUD operations. The framework uses Dotenv for environment variable management, PDO for database interactions, and a custom router to handle different HTTP methods and routes.

## Features

- **Routing System**: Allows defining routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
- **Controller Management**: Routes are connected to controller methods that handle business logic.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses the Dotenv library to load environment variables (e.g., database connection settings) from a `.env` file.
- **Basic CRUD**: The application supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for entities like users.

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer (for dependency management)
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, or PHPâ€™s built-in server)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JairoJeffersont/easy_framework.git api_folder
cd api_folder
````

### 2. Install dependencies:

Run the following command to install required PHP libraries using Composer:

```bash
composer install
````

### 3. Set up environment variables:

Edit the .env file to set up your environment variables, including database connection settings:

````
DB_DRIVER=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_NAME=my_database
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
````

### 4. Create the database:

Ensure your MySQL server is running and create the database specified in your .env file.

```bash
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
````

### 5. Deploy:

You have two options to deploy this aplication:

#### Option 1: Using PHP's Built-in Development Server

If you prefer not to configure a full web server like Apache or Nginx, you can use PHP's built-in development server with the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

#### Option 2: Using Apache or Ngix server

If you prefer to use a server like Apache or Nginx, configure the DocumentRoot to point to the public folder using a Virtual Host (vhost).

### Example Routes

Here are some example routes defined in the application:

```
// Fetch all users (GET request)
$router->get('/users', 'App\Controllers\UserController@index');

// Create a new user (POST request)
$router->post('/users', 'App\Controllers\UserController@store');
```
